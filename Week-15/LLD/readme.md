1. Run `npm i` to install the needed dependencies.

3. To take CLI input, run `node index.js cli` and this will provide an interactive terminal to create parking lots and do all the other stuffs given in the problem statement Press `Ctrl+C` to exit.
4. To give file as input run `node index.js file file.txt` where `file.txt` is the pathname for the file. Once you hit enter, it will automatically run all the inputs and show the output on the console. Take a look at the `file.txt` file for reference.
